                        Watch the weather closely.  The show goes on no matter what the weather is doing. You must wear your chip timing piece during the entire event. 
                        You will be given a band that will hold your chip timing piece around your ankle throughout the entire event. <strong>Be sure that it is snapped tightly.</strong>
                        Be sure to have your Chip Timing piece on before you start the race and be sure to step over the timing mats after each segment of the race.
                        If you are wearing a wet-suit, make sure the timing piece goes under your wetsuit otherwise, you will have a very difficult time getting off your wet suit.
                        Remember to bring a change of clothing so you can enjoy the post-event festivities.

                        Wetsuits are optional for the swim but will provide buoyancy and warmth. However, many people opt for no wetsuit for a triathlon so no worries.  We will provide you with a swim cap but you will want to bring your own goggles.

                        You must finish the race with your bib number on the front of you.  
                        Some people choose to pin it on at the beginning of the race and have it on for the whole event so they don't have to worry about it.  
                        Others pin it on a singlet that they put on once they finish the swim before they head out for the bike.  
                        Others use an elastic racing strap that they pin their bib number to and then quickly strap it on before they leave for the run.  
                        Use whatever option feels best for you.
